## 📌 Overview  
This project is based on the Johns Hopkins University **COVID-19 Data Repository**.  
I have adapted it for learning **data science and machine learning** concepts such as data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.  

The dataset provides global COVID-19 case counts, deaths, and recovery numbers. It has been widely used for research, forecasting, and dashboards during the pandemic.
